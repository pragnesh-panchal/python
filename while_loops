Format for while loop:

======================================
while condition :
       <block of repeating code>
======================================


print("While loops practice execution")
count = int(input("Enter a number"))

if count > 20:
    print "Number is greater than the number stored in the script"
    print "Good Bye"
else:
    while(count < 20):
      print("Script running this many times ", count)
      count = count + 1

Script running this many times 13
Script running this many times 14
Script running this many times 15
Script running this many times 16
